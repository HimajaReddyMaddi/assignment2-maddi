#### Algorithm for Power of Factorial Divisor
> Find maximum power of a number that divides a factorial. If multiple powers of a prime factor are present in n, then we divide the count to get the maximum power value for this factor. 
GeeksforGeeks<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-power-number-divides-factorial/>

```
int fact_pow (int n, int k) {
    int res = 0;
    while (n) {
        n /= k;
        res += n;
    }
    return res;
}

```
